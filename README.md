I've been blogging on WordPress for 8 years now, unfortunately. I've found Wordpress incredibly slow, especially given the content can be made completely static. Luckily the world has taken noticed, with the recent [explosion of static blogging frameworks](https://www.staticgen.com/). 

This repo has the contents of my site as I port it to Hugo. If you like the place, feel free to use the code as an exemplar, however, the blog content is &copy; Joseph Lust 2016.
