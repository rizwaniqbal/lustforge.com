Cygwin is amazing for those of us stuck on Windows. The bell is not always so grand. I prefer a visible bell (like in Putty) rather than a &#8220;ding!&#8221; when I&#8217;ve got my music going.

To enable the visible bell add the following to **~/.bashrc**

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">set bell-style visible
</pre>

<div>
  Ah, that&#8217;s much better! Thanks again Cygwin!
