I&#8217;m writing to tell you how to fix this error since it just drove me mad for 20 minutes.

If you are an avid user of [**Console2**][1], which any Windows user should be, you might notice one day that your **arrow keys scroll up and down, rather than select the most recent command**. Why the heck would that happen? It does not happen in the Microsoft cmd window, but it will in [Cygwin][2] and Cmd under [Console2][1].

You see, you&#8217;ve left on the **SCROLL LOCK**, that anachronistic key that we never understand. No other terminal on your machine will act weird, but [<div id="attachment_25" style="width: 238px" class="wp-caption alignright">
