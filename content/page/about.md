Joe Lust (*homo Lusticus*) is a adult male human commonly found in the northern latitudes of the Americas. He is `177cm` nose to tail and varies from `70` to `73kg` with seasonal foraging. Generally social, he may be approached in most environments. He is  especially renowned for a tendency toward prolonged periods of computer coding. He may also engage in distance runs of up to `32km` for no apparent mating or nutritional benefit.

Sightings most commonly occur along the Charles River Basin or other wooded paths. Continued research is required to better understand his migratory habits and feeding grounds.
